                      An IT compliance framework is a structured set of guidelines, best practices, and controls that an organization follows to meet the requirements of laws, regulations, and industry standards. Think of it as a detailed roadmap for securing data and systems. By implementing a framework, a company demonstrates to its customers, partners, and regulators that it takes security and privacy seriously and has a formal program in place to manage risks.
